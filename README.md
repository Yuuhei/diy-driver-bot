# diy-driver-bot
 A simple Discord bot written in Python for SoundBytes PH. Searches the matching user's DIY earbud driver search query and sends the info of that search!

# Setup
Install requirements.txt `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Add your token in `config.json`, configure your preferred suffix (yes still using suffix in 2023, f*ck slash commands)

Run `main.py`

That's it. test your bot on your server to see if it works.

# Contribution
This entire code is WIP, so some major changes can happen. Also i'm still noob at coding, please spare me UwU

You can push a driver info in .json file if you want, just follow the `template.json` inside `driver-repo` folder.

You can join my Discord Server for support and everything else as long as it's audio gear topic.
